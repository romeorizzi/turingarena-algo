Let $a$ and $b$ be two positive integers.
The *greatest common divisor* $\gcd(a,b)$ of $a$ and $b$ is the maximum integer which divides both $a$ and $b$.

A friend of us needs our help in computing the *greatest common divisor* of two secret numbers $a$ and $b$, but can not disclose the value of $a$ and $b$ to us.
He can test (and let us know) when the two numbers are odd or even, also, when they are even, we can request him to halven them up.
Another operation he can perform is the replacing of the pair $a,b$
with the sum and the difference of $a$ and $b$.

Can you guide the steps of your friend so that he will move from pair to pair while maintaing invariant the greatest common divisor of the two naturals comprising the pair, till finally the two numbers will be equal among themselves, whence also equal to their greatest common divisor?
