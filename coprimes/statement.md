Decide whether two numbers <param>a</param> and <param>b</param> are coprime or not.

<description for="are_coprime">

Takes in input two positive naturals <param>a</param> and <param>b</param>.
In case <param>a</param> and <param>b</param> are NOT coprime, it should answer NO (returning the integer value 0) but also provide a certificate calling the function give_divisor(d) to return some common divisor d > 1.
In case <param>a</param> and <param>b</param> are coprime, it should answer YES (returning the integer value 1) but also provide a certificate calling the function give_multipliers(x,y) to return two integers x and y such that xa+yb = 1.
