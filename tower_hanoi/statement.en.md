In the figure you see a wooden set of the tower of Hanoi puzzle game.

![Hanoi tower with $8$ disks.](figures/220px-Tower_of_Hanoi.jpeg)

Three vertical rods rise up from a basement.
We are also given <n> wooden disks of different sizes, and numbered from <1> to <n>, from the smallest to the largest. The disks are actually donuts, that is, they have an hole which allows to slide them onto the vertical rods.
The puzzle starts with the disks orderly stacked on the first rod, the smallest disk <1> at the top, thus making a conical shape resting on the largest disk <n> placed over the wooden basement.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the third rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Can you solve the puzzle?
Can you find a solution taking only the minimum possible number of moves?
